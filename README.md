I used the foundation framework to build the bare bones of the website before adding various elements through the help of JavaScript and CSS. I incorporated Google Maps API to automatically pull addresses from their database, locked to NZ locations only. Utilizing DOM manipulation and AJAX queries, I was able to submit form data via external php files without reloading or impacting user experience.
